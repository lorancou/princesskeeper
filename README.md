Rise towers, imprison princesses, watch knights trying to destabilize you
protective custody. Be a REAL VILLAIN, don't let them succeed! 

Ah, yes, some of those knights try to disguise themselves. Don't let them fool
you. Maybe they're real goats, who knows. Anyways, keep your focus and your
prisoner.
